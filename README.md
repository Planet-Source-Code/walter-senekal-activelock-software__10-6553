Hi all
I am part of the Activelock Software development team.
Activelock is a OPEN SOURCE - SOFTWARE LICENSING, COPY PROTECTION SYSTEM
You can visit the homepage at:
http://activelocksoftware.com/
We have open source software protection and licensing software. It will block some decompiles to access program and it will create license keys for your software with many selectable options.
We also have an Activelock Wizard that can help with the integration of Activelock into your application.
If you do not like it, please let us know and we will try to accommodate your request into the software.
Best regards
Walter
